# React Snake

My first ever React project, straight out of training! Practicing the fundamentals, getting a little Tailwind practice in for good measure, and making a little green snake move across the screen and grow as she eats.

[Take a look](awebdragon.github.io/react-snake/) - and feel free to go through the files, too. Beware of self-learner / nerdy comments.

Current progress: the game loop is completed for the player-controlled version. I'll be keeping this version as a fallback, but the whole point of this project was to get the snake playing _herself_.

Next steps: clean up the main App so that game logic and other utilities are separated into other files. This is a preparation step for creating the default self-playing game mode.

Far future upgrades: learning typescript and getting it integrated - just as an excuse to learn more. Maybe mobile controls if I'm feeling up to it.
